    "1) Logistic regression basics/details\n",
    "* Motivation:\n",
    "    * With linear regression, we are modeling a continuous response and finding the linear function that give the best fit\n",
    "    * But, what happens if we try linear regression for *binary* response (e.g. yes/no)\n",
    "![lin_reg_binary](linear_regression_binary.png)\n",
    "* Logistic regression properties:\n",
    "    * Takes continuous input (e.g. $(-\\infty,\\infty)$\n",
    "    * Produces output between 0 and 1\n",
    "    * Transitions from outputting 0 to outputting 1 quickly\n",
    "    * Has interpretable coefficients (similar to linear regression)\n",
    "![log_reg](logistic_regression.png)\n",
    "* **Sigmoid (logistic) function** - an S-shaped curve (sigmoid curve) that have domain of all real numbers, with return value monotonically increasing most often from 0 to 1 or alternatively from âˆ’1 to 1, depending on convention\n",
    "    * Equation: $$S(x)=\\frac{e^x}{e^x + 1}=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$$\n",
    "    * For logistic regression: $$p(y)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-X\\beta}}$$ <center> where $p(y)$ denotes the probability of success of $y$ (mean of the response) </center>\n",
    "    * How do we get this function?\n",
    "        * **Link function** - provides the relationship between a linear combination of our inputs ($X\\beta$) and the mean of the response ($p(y)$)\n",
    "        * Equation: $$\\begin{align} ln(\\frac{p(y)}{1-p(y)}) & = X\\beta \\\\\n",
    "            \\frac{p(y_i)}{1-p(y_i)} & = e^{X\\beta} \\\\\n",
    "            p(y_i) & = (1-p(y_i))e^{X\\beta} \\\\\n",
    "            p(y_i) & = e^{X\\beta}-p(y_i)e^{X\\beta} \\\\\n",
    "            p(y_i)+p(y_i)e^{X\\beta} & = e^{X\\beta} \\\\\n",
    "            p(y_i)(1+e^{X\\beta}) & = e^{X\\beta} \\\\\n",
    "            p(y_i) & = \\frac{e^{X\\beta}}{1+e^{X\\beta}} \\\\\n",
    "            p(y_i) & = \\frac{\\frac{e^{X\\beta}}{e^{X\\beta}}}{\\frac{1+e^{X\\beta}}{e^{X\\beta}}} \\\\\n",
    "            p(y_i) & = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-X\\beta}} \\\\\n",
    "            \\end{align}$$\n",
    "* Linear vs Logistic regression assumptions:\n",
    "    * In linear regression, we assume: $y_i | X $~$N(X\\beta,\\sigma^2)$ (Gaussian/Normal Distribution)\n",
    "    * In logistic regression, we assume: $y_i | X$~$Bernoulli(p)$ (Bernoulli distribution)\n",
    "        * In binary classification: $y_i = $$\\begin{cases} \n",
    "        1  & \\text{if event occurs} \\\\\n",
    "        0 & \\text{if event doesn't occur}\n",
    "        \\end{cases}$\n",
    "* Estimating through **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)** - parameters of logistic regression is estimated through maximum likelihood\n",
    "    1. Each individual observation follows **Bernoulli Distribution**: $$y_i | X \\text{ ~ } Bernoulli(p) \\rightarrow P(X) = p^x(1-p)^{1-x}$$\n",
    "    2. Given the distribution type, the **likelihood** of our $\\beta$ matrix is: $$L(\\beta|y)=\\prod_{i=1}^N p(y_i)^{y_i}+(1-p(y_i))^{(1-y_i)}$$\n",
    "    3. Then, convert to **log likelihood**: $$l=\\sum_{i=1}^N y_i log(p(y_i))+(1-y_i)log(1-p(y_i))$$\n",
    "        * Unfortunately, **no closed form solution**, thus, iterative methods are typically used (e.g. **SGD**)\n",
    "        * Work with the first/second derivatives to try to take clever steps towards an optimal solution with a random guess start\n",
    "* **Interpreting the Results:**\n",
    "    * Example: Fit logistic regression model with outcome/response as **whether or not a person works** ($1$ or $0$ $\\rightarrow$ y or n) and only **one predictor, income**: $$p(y)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\\beta_0+X_{income}\\beta_{income})}}$$\n",
    "        * To interpret the coefficients, use **link function**: $$\\begin{align} ln(\\frac{p(y)}{1-p(y)}) & = \\beta_0+X_{income}\\beta_{income} \\\\\n",
    "                \\frac{p(y)}{1-p(y)} & = e^{\\beta_0+X_{income}\\beta_{income}} \\\\\n",
    "                \\frac{p(y)}{1-p(y)} & = e^{\\beta_0}e^{X_{income}\\beta_{income}} \\\\\n",
    "                \\end{align}$$\n",
    "        * The **Odds Ratio**: $$\\frac{p(y)}{1-p(y)}$$\n",
    "        * Interpretation: for a one-unit increase in $X_1$, the odds increases by $e^{\\beta_{income}}$\n",
    "            * $\\beta_1=0.00001 \\rightarrow$ one-unit increase in income, $\\$1$, causes an $e^{0.00001}$ increase in the odds of somebody working: $e^{0.00001}=1.00001$\n",
    "            * Basically, for each additional dollar that a person makes, we expect a $0.001\\%$ increase in the odds that they are working\n",
    "            * For an additional $\\$1000$ dollars that a person makes, we expect $1\\%$ increase in the odds that they work: $0.0001*1000.0=1.0\\%$"
